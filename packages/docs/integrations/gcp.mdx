# Google Cloud Platform Integration

The Google Cloud Platform (GCP) integration allows you to connect your GCP projects to Comp AI for automated compliance monitoring, and risk assessment.

## Setup Process

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the integration, ensure you have:

1. GCP project with Owner or Editor access
2. Admin access to your Comp AI workspace
3. Permissions to create service accounts

### Configuration Steps

1. Navigate to **Settings > Integrations** in your Comp AI dashboard  
2. Click on **Connect** next to the GCP integration card  
3. Link Service Account  
    - Go to the [GCP Console → IAM & Admin → Service Accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts)  
    - Click **“Create Service Account”** and give it a name like `comp-ai-integration`
    - Click **Continue**, then grant the following roles:
        - `Security Center Findings Viewer` (`roles/securitycenter.findingsViewer`)
        - *(Optional)* `Viewer` (`roles/viewer`)
    - Complete the service account creation
    - After creating the service account:
        - Go to the **“Keys”** tab
        - Click **“Add Key” → “Create new key”**, select **JSON**, then click **Create**
        - Download the key — you’ll use this in the next step
    - Go to the [API Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library) and enable:
        - **Security Command Center API**
        - **Cloud Resource Manager API**
    - Open the downloaded JSON file, and copy its entire contents  
    - Paste it into the **Service Account Key** field in the Comp AI connection form  
4. Click **Save and Connect**

## Capabilities

### Security Tests

The GCP integration performs the following security assessments:

| Test Category | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| IAM Analysis | Review IAM roles and service account permissions |
| GCS Security | Identify improperly configured bucket permissions and encryption |
| Compute Security | Analyze firewall rules, instance configurations, and patch status |
| Database Security | Check Cloud SQL, Firestore, and other database security settings |
| Cloud Logging | Verify proper logging and monitoring configuration |
| KMS | Validate encryption key usage and rotation policies |
| Network | Assess VPC configurations, firewall rules, and load balancer settings |

### Compliance Frameworks

The integration checks compliance against:

- CIS GCP Foundation Benchmark
- SOC 2
- HIPAA (where applicable)
- PCI DSS
- GDPR
- ISO 27001

## Managing Access

### Access Control

Comp AI requires read-only access to your GCP environment. The integration uses a service account with specific IAM roles that follow the principle of least privilege.

### Permissions

The service account has the following roles:

- Viewer (roles/viewer) at project level
- Security Reviewer (roles/iam.securityReviewer)
- Storage Object Viewer (roles/storage.objectViewer)

The integration does NOT have permissions to:
- Modify any resources
- Create new resources
- Delete existing resources

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Failed to connect GCP project  
**Solution**: Verify organization id and service account key and IAM permissions

**Issue**: Missing scan results for specific services  
**Solution**: Check IAM permissions for those specific services

**Issue**: Authentication errors  
**Solution**: Ensure the service account key is valid and not expired
