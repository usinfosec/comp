# Azure Integration

The Azure integration enables you to connect your Microsoft Azure cloud environment to Comp AI for comprehensive security testing, compliance monitoring, and risk assessment using Microsoft Defender for Cloud

## Setup Process

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the integration, ensure you have:

1. Azure subscription with Owner or Contributor access
2. Admin access to your Comp AI workspace
3. Permissions to register applications in Azure AD

### Configuration Steps

### Configuration Steps

1. **Log into your Azure Portal**  
   - Visit [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)

2. **Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud**  
   - In the left-hand menu, search for and select **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**  
   - Click **Getting started**  
   - Select the subscription(s) you want to onboard  
   - Enable **Microsoft Defender plans** (especially for relevant services like Compute, Storage, SQL, etc.)  
   - Wait for the provisioning to complete (this may take a few minutes)

3. **Register an Application in Azure AD**  
   - Navigate to **Azure Active Directory > App registrations**  
   - Click **+ New registration**  
   - Name the app (e.g., `CompAIIntegrationApp`)  
   - Choose **Accounts in this organizational directory only**  
   - Click **Register**  

4. **Get the Client ID and Tenant ID**  
   - After registration, go to the app's **Overview** page  
   - Copy the **Application (client) ID**  
   - Copy the **Directory (tenant) ID**

5. **Create a Client Secret**  
   - In the app menu, go to **Certificates & secrets**  
   - Under **Client secrets**, click **+ New client secret**  
   - Add a description and set an expiration  
   - Click **Add**  
   - Copy the **Client secret value** — you won’t be able to see it again!

6. **Assign the Application Access to a Subscription**  
   - Go to **Subscriptions** in the Azure portal  
   - Select the subscription you want to integrate  
   - Copy the **Subscription ID**  
   - Click **Access control (IAM)**  
   - Click **+ Add > Add role assignment**  
   - Select role: **Reader** (or **Security Reader** for enhanced visibility)  
   - Assign access to: **User, group, or service principal**  
   - Select your registered application  

7. **Connect Azure to Comp AI**  
   - Go to **Settings > Integrations** in your Comp AI dashboard  
   - Click **Connect** next to the Azure integration card  
   - Paste the following values:  
     - **Client ID**  
     - **Client Secret**  
     - **Tenant ID**  
     - **Subscription ID**  
   - Click **Save and Connect**


## Capabilities

### Security Tests

The Azure integration performs the following security assessments:

| Test Category | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| IAM Analysis | Review Azure AD roles and custom RBAC assignments |
| Storage Security | Identify improperly configured storage account permissions and encryption |
| VM Security | Analyze NSGs, VM configurations, and patch status |
| Database Security | Check Azure SQL, Cosmos DB, and other database security settings |
| Activity Logs | Verify proper logging and monitoring configuration |
| Key Vault | Validate secret management and key rotation policies |
| Network | Assess VNet configurations, NSGs, and service endpoints |

### Compliance Frameworks

The integration checks compliance against:

- Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark
- SOC 2
- HIPAA (where applicable)
- PCI DSS
- GDPR
- ISO 27001

## Managing Access

### Access Control

Comp AI requires read-only access to your Azure environment. The integration uses Azure's built-in Reader role or custom roles with specific permissions that follow the principle of least privilege.

### Permissions

The Azure application/service principal has permissions for:

- Reading resource configurations
- Listing resources and their attributes
- Viewing diagnostic settings

The integration does NOT have permissions to:
- Modify any resources
- Create new resources
- Delete existing resources

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Failed to connect Azure subscription  
**Solution**: Verify service principal credentials and role assignments

**Issue**: Missing scan results for specific services  
**Solution**: Check RBAC permissions for those specific resource providers

**Issue**: Authentication errors  
**Solution**: Ensure the service principal hasn't expired and secret is valid
