# AWS Integration

The AWS integration allows you to connect your AWS infrastructure to Comp AI for automated security testing using Security Hub, compliance monitoring, and risk assessment.

## Setup Process

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the integration, ensure you have:

1. An AWS account with administrator access
2. Admin access to your Comp AI workspace
3. IAM permissions to create and manage roles, policies, and trust relationships

### Configuration Steps

### Configuration Steps

1. **Log into your AWS Management Console**

2. **Enable Security Hub**

   - Navigate to **Security Hub** in the AWS Console
   - Click **Get Started**
   - Enable Security Hub in your **desired regions**
   - Optionally, enable **default security standards** (like CIS AWS Foundations)

3. **Choose a Region Code**

   - Decide which AWS region you want Comp AI to use (e.g., `us-east-1`, `us-west-2`)
   - Copy this region code — you’ll need it in the Comp AI UI

4. **Create an IAM User for Comp AI**

   - Go to **IAM > Users**, then click **Add user**
   - Enter a name like `CompAIIntegrationUser`
   - Choose **Programmatic access** (this generates the Access Key ID & Secret)

5. **Set Permissions**

   - On the permissions screen, click **Attach policies directly**
   - Attach the following AWS managed policies:
     - `SecurityAudit`
     - `ReadOnlyAccess`

   _(Or use a custom least-privilege policy — see example below)_

6. **Create the User**

   - Click **Next**, then **Create user**
   - Copy and securely store the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**
   - You will only see the secret once!

7. **Connect AWS to Comp AI**
   - Go to **Settings > Integrations** in your Comp AI dashboard
   - Click **Connect** next to the AWS integration card
   - Paste the **Access Key ID**, **Secret Access Key**, and **Region Code**
   - Click **Save and Connect**

## Capabilities

### Security Tests

The AWS integration performs the following security assessments:

| Test Category | Description
| IAM Misconfigurations | Detects overly permissive roles, users, or policies
| S3 Bucket Security | Checks for public access, encryption, and versioning
| EC2 Instance | Analysis Reviews security group rules, instance metadata access
| Security Hub | Findings Integrates AWS Security Hub findings for real-time insights
| CloudTrail | Configuration Verifies CloudTrail logging and monitoring
| Config & Compliance Checks | Audits AWS Config rules and compliance state

### Compliance Frameworks

- The integration checks compliance against:
- CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark
- SOC 2
- HIPAA (where applicable)
- PCI DSS
- GDPR
- ISO 27001

## Managing Access

### Access Control

Comp AI uses a cross-account IAM role with read-only permissions and a required external ID to ensure secure, scoped access. This approach follows AWS best practices for secure third-party integrations.

### Permissions

The IAM role created for integration has permissions to:

- Describe resources (EC2, S3, IAM, etc.)
- Read configuration and audit logs
- Access Security Hub and CloudTrail
- List AWS Config and resource statuses
- The integration does NOT have permissions to:

Modify any resources

- Create or delete resources
- Write to S3 or other services
