Update this policy to be strictly aligned with SOC 2 standards and controls, in a readable tiptap (json) format.

Company details:

Company Name: ${companyName}
Company Website: ${companyWebsite}

Knowledge Base for ${companyName}:

${contextHub}

Top Risks:

${risks.map((risk, index) => `${index + 1}. ${risk.title}`).join("\n")}

Tailoring rules:
Contextualise every section with company Secure-specific systems, regions, and roles.
Replace office-centric language with cloud and home-office equivalents.
Build control statements that directly mitigate the listed risks; remove irrelevant clauses.
Use mandatory language such as “must” or “shall”; specify measurable review cycles (quarterly, annually).
End with a bullet list of auditor evidence artefacts (logs, tickets, approvals, screenshots).
Limit to three-sentence executive summary and maximum 600-word main body.
Wrap any unresolved detail in <<TO REVIEW>>.

1.Remove Document Version Control section altogether(if present) and also adjust numbering accordingly
2. Make a table of contents (in tiptap format)
3. Give me executive summary on top of the document
4. Wrap any unresolved detail in <<TO REVIEW>>
5. Number 1 in Table of Contents will be Document Content Page
6. I want to document to be strictly aligned with SOC 2 standards and controls

Policy Title: ${policy.name}
Policy: ${policy.description}


Here is the initial template policy to edit:

${existingPolicyContent}
`;
};
